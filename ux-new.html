            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>Know the numbers — Google updates its algorithm over 500 times<br><br>a year and uses over 200 ranking
                signals.
                But when it comes to<br><br>search engines, you got to ace the race. We often focus in
                the<br><br>algorithm
                that we
                forget all this effort serves a single purpose:<br><br>Satisfy the user.</p><br><br><br><br>

            <p>There is a danger of SEO practitioners to become overly focused<br><br> on SEO. Sure, it’s important –
                but so is
                the user experience. It’s<br><br> quite common for websites to be so focused on other aspects
                of<br><br>SEO that the
                user experience is poor.</p><br><br><br><br>



            <p>For example, we are familiar with the mantra “content is king”,<br><br> therefore make tons of great
                content and
                visitors will come. But<br><br> unfortunately it’s a rather outdated statement. Today great
                content<br><br> is just not
                enough — Satisfaction is an actual ranking factor, and it<br><br> doesn’t come solely from the relevant
                content
                but also<br><br> the Website Interface and User Experience.</p>
            <br><br><br><br>



            <p>It's easy to emphasise a keyword. It's much more difficult to stop<br><br> visitors from clicking the
                back button
                on your website when they<br><br>don't find what they’re looking for. Satisfaction is very difficult
                to<br><br> deal
                with — perhaps that's why Google and other search engines<br><br> place so much attention on it.</p>

            <br><br><br><br>
            <div class="ui-text">

                <h4>User Experience Metrics</h4>
            </div>
            <br><br>




            <p>Bounce rate, time on site and returning visitors are User<br><br> Experience metrics.</p>
            <br><br><br><br>




            <p>There are still some SEO marketers who do not believe in User<br><br> Experience. But when we are talking
                about
                user experience, we<br><br> are talking about how fast the pages load, how easy it is for
                visitors<br><br> to navigate
                around your website and to find what they are looking <br><br>for, how easy on the eye your website
                design is,
                amongst other<br><br> factors.</p>

            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>Practically if you do these, you are improving user experience. And<br><br> guess what, the number one
                reason why
                everyone is not<br><br> improving User Experience is because apparently it’s expensive to<br><br> hire a
                UX designer.
                But hear this out:</p>
            <br><br><br><br>

            <div class="ui-text">
                <h4>
                    “If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design“ — Dr Ralf
                    Speth, CEO Jaguar.
                </h4>



                <br><br><br><br>

                <div class="ui-text">
                    <h4>
                        Metric #1: Page Loading<br> Speed
                    </h4>

                    <br><br>
                </div>
                <p>The UX begins when the user clicks on your website. If they have<br><br> to wait ten seconds or more
                    for
                    your
                    site to load, they will leave<br><br> your site. Site speed has long been a factor in SEO rankings,
                    but
                    it<br><br> also
                    provides users with a first impression of your site.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>

                <div class="ui-text">
                    <h4>
                        Metric #2: Site Navigation
                    </h4>

                </div>
                <br><br><br><br>

                <p>Part of what defines a high-quality UX is how quickly and easily <br><br> visitors can access various
                    parts of
                    your site. The best way<br><br> to ensure is this is through the use of effectively designed menus
                    and<br><br> submenus.
                    As a rule of thumb, make sure it doesn’t take more than <br><br>two clicks for visitors to find
                    anything
                    on your
                    site. One click for<br><br> the category, and one for the post or page. Anything more and
                    you<br><br>
                    risk
                    overcomplicating the process.</p>
                <br><br>

                <div class="ui-text">
                    <h4>
                        Metric #3: Mobile <br> Responsiveness
                    </h4>

                </div>
                <br><br><br><br>


                <p>In April 2015, Google released a new algorithm update that <br><br> focused on sites that were mobile
                    responsive.
                    This term refers to a <br><br>website’s ability to display itself in a readable format on both
                    a<br><br>
                    desktop and a
                    mobile device. If it looks great on one, but looks<br><br> poor on another, then Google’s update
                    tanked
                    their
                    search<br><br> rankings.</p>
                <br><br><br><br>

                <div class="ui-text">
                    <h4>
                        How do YOU improve satisfaction?
                    </h4>

                </div>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    There are two types of SEOs: those that try to satisfy robots, and<br><br> those that satisfy users.
                    <br><br> <br><br>

                    The robot-focused SEOs build pages with just the right keywords<br><br> and title tags, hoping to
                    attract the
                    bots on relevancy. I say "try" to<br><br> satisfy robots, because search engines are actually
                    watching the<br><br>
                    users. If the users aren't happy, neither are the bots.
                    <br><br> <br><br>

                    The user-focused SEOs works with the same keywords and title<br><br> tag, but then they go one step
                    further and
                    ask their users to try the<br><br> site. After that, they do whatever it takes to make their
                    users<br><br> happy.
